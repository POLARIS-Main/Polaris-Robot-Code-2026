# Setup

To ensure that you have the correct environment setup, we made a simple step-by-step guide below so you can edit, build, and deploy code onto our Teensy 4.1 board.

## VS Code
- I would suggest using VS Code in this instance, even though you could use any, it would make it a lot harder to build and deploy code onto the board. Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Along with that, you will need to download Git, which you can find here [https://git-scm.com/install/](https://git-scm.com/install/), and, although optional, GitHub Desktop, found here [https://desktop.github.com/download/](https://desktop.github.com/download/)

#### VS Code Extensions
Since we are using the Teensy 4.1, we will need some extensions to help us build and deploy code on the board.
Documentation can be found for the board at [https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/teensy/teensy41.html](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/teensy/teensy41.html)
If you don't want to figure out how to set that up all by yourself, I've got you.
- In VS Code, open the package manager or extensions manager.
- Search for the official PlatformIO IDE and click install.
- You will then want to go to the top search bar and search >PlatformIO:Focus on Quick Access View (It should pop up). If it asks to download anything, say yes, if it's in VS Code
- This should then open PIO Home. You should be good from here, and you can go ahead and clone the repository! YAA!
